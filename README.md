# AIRValidator
Extendable, rule-based validator for Swift.

## Usage

### Validating
```swift
let value = "not empty"
/*
`validate` method:
- parameter rules: Array of Rules.
- returns: Result pattern
  * Valid
  * Invalid([Rule]): returns invalid rules
*/
switch value.validate([RequiredRule()]) {
case .Valid:
  print('Valid')
case .Invalid(let rules):
  print('Invalid for rules: \(rules)')
}
```

### New Rule
```swift
public struct RequiredRule: Rule {
  public func validate<T>(value: T) -> Bool {
    switch value {
    // Write cases for supporting types
    case let value as String:
      return !value.isEmpty
    default:
        // otherwise return false
        return false
    }
  }
}
